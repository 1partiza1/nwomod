## Devolution '''TODO''' ##

Devolution is the process of a county dissolving into several smaller entities, based on a regions with a non primary culture as
majority or in special cases historic "cores".

### Start: Unitarian State ###
The starting point for a devolutionary process is crime.
Steps of devolution
# province has a minority pop with own core, and there is a sectarian divied with a dominating culture by numbers or policy.
# increase level on disconnect based on unemployment, militancy. Reduced risk by reform promote\_minoroties.
# province gets timed demand\_autonomy. Gov may deny or accept - partial (e.g. only province or all with core in country).
> if gov. deny province gets denied\_autonomy
> if gov. accept province autonomy - create puppet or if pupet exists transfer sovereignty to puppet state. If state is independent, gov. have to deny autonomy.
# province has denied\_autonomy will triggered by crimes get insurrection\_modifier.
> Country gets insatiability interest penalty level1.
> gov. can respond with policing
> gov. can respond with minority\_supression
> gov. can accept prov autonomy.)
# province has insurrection\_modifier, remove insurrection\_modifier add violent\_revolt\_modifier.
> Country gets insatiability interest penalty level2.
> gov. can respond with (continued) minority\_supression
> gov. can accept prov autonomy.)
# province has violent\_revolt\_modifier, MMT**) remove violent\_revolt\_modifier add sectarian\_breakdown
> Country gets insatiability interest penalty level3 and militancy
> gov. can respond with continued minority\_supression
> gov. can respond with sectarian\_wall and continued minority\_supression. Sectarian wall costs in admin efficiency, gives suppression points.
> gov. can accept prov autonomy.****)
these options then repeat themselves
# if a province with sectarian\_breakdown ever not is\_controlled by owner, we get civilwar\_modifier.
# province with civilwar\_modifier and controlled by owner, remove civilwar\_modifier and add sectarian\_breakdown
> Country gets insatiability interest penalty level4 and tax revenue penalty.
> gov. can respond with minority\_supression
> gov. can respond with sectarian\_wall and minority\_supression
> gov. can accept prov autonomy. -> country gets forced\_autonomy, i.e.will try and become independent.**

> x) ethnic\_cleancing, minority\_supression increase emigration from province.
> xx) ethnic\_cleancing causes bad\_boy.

> minority\_supression is a province modifer, with time-out. On timeout read minority\_supression if province has sectarian\_wall.

### Start Autonomic - Puppet ###

# Increase level on disconnect based on unemployment, militancy, and (forced\_autonomy and (is\_democracy or dictatorship\_party\_election)). Reduced risk by reform promote\_minoroties or capital\_province majority pop is\_primary of puppeteer Y.
# Country gets timed modifier demand\_independance.
> if puppeteer. deny  gets denied\_independance
> if puppeteer accepts. Release puppet.
# If puppet has denied\_independance MTT y). Remove denied\_independance
> puppet gets option declare independence.
> or puppet get option stay puppet.
# puppet declares independence
> puppeteer war make\_puppet (if not pupeteerer in default)
> puppeteer war release country(s). TODO how to make pupeteerer to assert iflunce in puppet.
> puppeteer accept.
# if puppeteer won the war to liberate country.
> liberated country become puppet of puppeteer if puppeteer is major or great power

## Evolution - Annexation of Puppet  '''TODO''' ##

You may annex a puppet nation peacefully if the puppet goes into bankruptcy. The puppet gets the option to accept or reject the annexation. If the puppet rejects the annexation proposal they will in effect declare independence - giving besides the become\_independent casus belli, the option for outright annexation of minor puppet states and acquire cores. Puppets with in a cultural union, will accept annexation.
If a puppet has a different government type than yours, you may declare war to reinstate your government type.
